# COM3529 Practical Session 3: Better Unit Testing

In the `code` directory, the package [`uk.ac.shef.com3529.forum`](../code/lib/src/main/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/forum/) represents an online forum, with users and posts. There are three classes to represent each of these aspects – [`Forum`](../code/lib/src/main/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/forum/Forum.java), [`User`](../code/lib/src/main/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/forum/User.java), and [`Post`](../code/lib/src/main/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/forum/Post.java) respectively. _Spend some time familiarising yourself with these classes and how they interact._

To test the `Forum` class, a JUnit test suite has been written in 
[`ForumTest`](../code/lib/src/test/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/forum/ForumTest.java). However, the tests suffer from a number of problems, including:

* Potential brittleness,
* Lack of clarity,
* Lack of conciseness,
* A focus on testing implementation, as opposed to behaviour.

## Your Tasks

Based on what you have learnt in lectures, take each test in `ForumTest` and:

1. Identify each of the potential issues with it, stating why it is/could be a problem.

2. Rewrite the test to remedy the problems you have identified.

3. Reflect on whether and how the new test addresses the issues you identified in (1) and in whether in fixing the existing issues, you accidentally introduced new ones.
